Lorem Khaled Ipsum is a major key to success. You smart, you loyal, you a genius. The other day the grass was brown, now it’s green because I ain’t give up. Never surrender. Let me be clear, you have to make it through the jungle to make it to paradise, that’s the key, Lion! In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key. Major key, don’t fall for the trap, stay focused. It’s the ones closest to you that want to see you fail. The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key.
